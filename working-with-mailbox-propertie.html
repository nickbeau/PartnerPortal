<h1 class="p_Heading1"><span class="f_Heading1">General</span></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use the General section to view or change basic information about the user.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First name, Initials, Last name</p>
<p>* Display name &nbsp; &nbsp;This name appears in your organization’s address book, on the To: and From: lines in email, and in the Mailbox list. This name can’t contain empty spaces before or after the display name.</p>
<p>* Alias This specifies the email alias for the user. The user’s alias is the portion of the email address on the left side of the at (@) symbol. It must be unique.</p>
<p>* User ID This is the name that the user uses to sign in to their mailbox and to log on to Office365. Typically the user logon name consists of the user’s alias on the left side of the @ symbol, and the domain name in which the user account resides on the right side of the @ symbol.</p>
<p>Hide from address lists &nbsp; Select this check box to prevent the recipient from appearing in the address book and other address lists that are defined in your Exchange organization. After you select this check box, users can still send messages to the recipient by using the email address.</p>
<p>Click More options to view or change these additional properties:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Custom attributes &nbsp; This section displays the custom attributes defined for the user mailbox. To specify custom attribute values, click Edit. You can specify up to 15 custom attributes for the recipient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mailbox Usage</p>
<p>Use the Mailbox Usage section to view or change the mailbox storage quota and deleted item retention settings for the mailbox. These settings are configured by default when the mailbox is created. They use the values that are configured for the mailbox database and apply to all mailboxes in that database. You can customize these settings for each mailbox instead of using the mailbox database defaults.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last logon &nbsp; This read-only box displays the last time that the user signed in to their mailbox.</p>
<p>Mailbox usage &nbsp; This area shows the total size of the mailbox and the percentage of the total mailbox quota that has been used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note</p>
<p>The online message says “Use this page if you want to change the quota for this user or specify how long to keep deleted items” but these settings aren’t available in the EAC in Exchange Online</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contact Information</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use the Contact Information section to view or change the user's contact information. The information on this page is displayed in the address book. Click More options to display additional boxes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organization</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Email Address</p>
<p>Use the Email Address section to view or change the email addresses associated with the user mailbox. This includes the user’s primary SMTP address and any associated proxy addresses. The primary SMTP address (also known as the default reply address) is displayed in bold text in the address list, with the uppercase SMTP value in the Type column. In Exchange Online there will also be a SIP address which is used for Lync – DO NOT CHANGE THIS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To add a secondary email address also known as a proxy address it is simply a matter of selecting Add here and typing the new address. Exchange Online mailboxes can have multiple email addresses through which they receive email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Add &nbsp; &nbsp;Click Add Add Iconto add a new email address for this mailbox. Select one of following address types:</p>
<p>SMTP &nbsp; This is the default address type. Click this button and then type the new SMTP address in the * Email address box.</p>

The Default Sharing Policy is assigned to mailboxes when they are created. To change the sharing policy that’s assigned to the user, select a different one from the drop-down list.</p>
<p>Role assignment policy &nbsp; This box shows the role assignment policy assigned to the mailbox. The role assignment policy specifies the role-based access control (RBAC) roles that are assigned to the user and control what specific mailbox and distribution group configuration settings users can modify. To change the role assignment policy that’s assigned to the user, select a different one from the drop-down list.</p>
<p>Retention policy &nbsp; This box shows the retention policy assigned to the mailbox. A retention policy is a group of retention tags that are applied to the user’s mailbox. They allow you to control how long to keep items in users' mailboxes and define what action to take on items that have reached a certain age. A retention policy isn’t assigned to mailboxes when they are created. To assign a retention policy to the user, select one from the drop-down list.</p>

An address book policy allows you to segment users into specific groups to provide customized views of the address book.

<p>All senders &nbsp; Select this option to specify that the user can accept messages from all senders. This includes both senders in your Exchange organization and external senders. This option is selected by default. This option includes external users only if you clear the Require that all senders are authenticated check box. If you select this check box, messages from external users will be rejected.</p>
<p>Only senders in the following list &nbsp; Select this option to specify that the user can accept messages only from a specified set of senders in your Exchange organization. Click Add Add Iconto display the Select Recipients page, which displays a list of all recipients in your Exchange organization. Select the recipients you want, add them to the list, and then click OK. You can also search for a specific recipient by typing the recipient’s name in the search box and then clicking Search Search Icon.</p>
<p>Require that all senders are authenticated &nbsp; Select this option to prevent anonymous users from sending messages to the user.</p>
<p>Reject messages from &nbsp; Use this section to block people from sending messages to this user.</p>
<p>No senders &nbsp; Select this option to specify that the mailbox won’t reject messages from any senders in the Exchange organization. This option is selected by default.</p>
<p>Senders in the following list &nbsp; Select this option to specify that the mailbox will reject messages from a specified set of senders in your Exchange organization. Click AddAdd Icon to display the Select Recipients page, which displays a list of all recipients in your Exchange organization.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use the Member Of section to view a list of the distribution groups or security groups to which this user belongs. You can't change membership information on this page. Note that the user may match the criteria for one or more dynamic distribution groups in your organization. However, dynamic distribution groups aren't displayed on this page because their membership is calculated each time they are used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MailTip</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use the MailTip section to add a MailTip to alert users of potential issues if they send a message to this recipient. A MailTip is text that is displayed in the InfoBar when this recipient is added to the To, Cc, or Bcc boxes of a new email message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mailbox Delegation</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use the Mailbox Delegation section to assign permissions to other users (also called delegates) to allow them to sign in to the user’s mailbox or send messages on behalf of the user. You can assign the following permissions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Send As &nbsp; This permission allows users other than the mailbox owner to use the mailbox to send messages. After this permission is assigned to a delegate, any message that a delegate sends from this mailbox will appear as if it was sent by the mailbox owner. However, this permission doesn’t allow a delegate to sign in to the user’s mailbox.</p>
<p>Send on Behalf Of &nbsp; This permission also allows a delegate to use this mailbox to send messages. However, after this permission is assigned to a delegate, the From: address in any message sent by the delegate indicates that the message was sent by the delegate on behalf of the mailbox owner.</p>
<p>Full Access &nbsp; This permission allows a delegate to sign in to the user’s mailbox and view the contents of the mailbox. However, after this permission is assigned to a delegate, the delegate can’t send messages from the mailbox. To allow a delegate to send email from the user’s mailbox, you still have to assign the delegate the Send As or the Send on Behalf Of permission.</p>
<p>To assign permissions to delegates, click Add Add Iconunder the appropriate permission to display a page that displays a list of all recipients in your Exchange organization that can be assigned the permission. Select the recipients you want, add them to the list, and then click OK. You can also search for a specific recipient by typing the recipient’s name in the search box and then clicking Search</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Granting a delegate access to another mailbox will not add the mailbox in Outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Details on how to do this are here https://hubone.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/200518414</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To SendAS or SendonBehalf– you will need to enable the From: button in Outlook</p>
