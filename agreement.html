<p>HubOne Partner Agreement</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This HubOne Partner Agreement (the &quot;Partner Agreement&quot;) is between the applicable partner (&quot;you&quot; or &quot;Partner&quot;), and HubOne Pty Ltd (ABN #16 129 333 795). If you are agreeing to this Partner Agreement not as an individual but on behalf of your company, then &quot;Partner&quot; or &quot;you&quot; means your company, and you are binding your company to this Partner Agreement. By agreeing to this Partner Agreement you are also confirming that you have the appropriate authority to sign this Partner Agreement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Partner Agreement is a separate agreement from the agreement that HubOne has with its end users at http://www.hubone.com/hubone-terms-conditions/ (as may be modified by HubOne from time to time, &quot;HubOne Terms and Conditions&quot;). For convenience and consistency, however, the definitions of certain terms related to our products and services (namely Software, Services, Products, and Users) will be the same as those in the HubOne Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Partner Agreement does not have to be signed in order to be binding. You indicate your assent to the terms by clicking on the &quot;I agree&quot; (or similar button) that is presented to you at the time of your order</p>

All such information must be accurate and complete and must reflect bona fide orders you have received from end users.</p><p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 18px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-size:16px; font-family: 'Tahoma';color:#000000;display:inline-block;width:18px;margin-left:-18px">2)</span>Limited Right to Resell.<br />

Except as otherwise set forth in this Partner Agreement, each party agrees that all code, inventions, know-how, business, technical and financial information it obtains (as &quot;Receiving Party&quot;) from the disclosing party (&quot;Disclosing Party&quot;) constitute the confidential property of the Disclosing Party (&quot;Confidential Information&quot;), provided that it is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should be reasonably known by the Receiving Party to be Confidential Information due to the nature of the information disclosed and the circumstances surrounding the disclosure. Any HubOne Technology and any performance information relating to the Products shall be deemed Confidential Information of HubOne without any marking or further designation. Except as expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party will hold in confidence and not use or disclose any Confidential Information. The Receiving Party’s nondisclosure obligation shall not apply to information which the Receiving Party can document:</p><p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 36px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-size:16px; font-family: 'Tahoma';color:#000000;display:inline-block;width:18px;margin-left:-18px">a)</span>was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information;</p><p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 36px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-size:16px; font-family: 'Tahoma';color:#000000;display:inline-block;width:18px;margin-left:-18px">b)</span>is or has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party;</p><p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 36px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-size:16px; font-family: 'Tahoma';color:#000000;display:inline-block;width:18px;margin-left:-18px">c)</span>is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; </p><p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 36px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-size:16px; font-family: 'Tahoma';color:#000000;display:inline-block;width:18px;margin-left:-18px">d)</span>is independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such information; or </p><p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 36px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-size:16px; font-family: 'Tahoma';color:#000000;display:inline-block;width:18px;margin-left:-18px">e)</span>is required to be disclosed pursuant to a regulation, law or court order (but only to the minimum extent required to comply with such regulation or order and with advance notice to the Disclosing Party).

For the avoidance of doubt, any and all commitments, indemnities and other terms and conditions offered by HubOne with respect to use of the Products are made directly by HubOne to the end user in accordance with the HubOne Customer Agreement and do not extend to you as a Partner.

The parties shall seek to mutually appoint an arbitrator. If the parties cannot agree on a single arbitrator, then there shall be three (3) arbitrators: one selected by each party, and a third selected by the first two.

This Partner Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the applicable laws of the State of New South Wales, Australia, without giving effect to the principles of that State relating to conflicts of laws. Each party irrevocably agrees that any legal action, suit or proceeding that is not otherwise subject to the arbitration provisions of Section 15.1 (Dispute Resolution; Arbitration) must be brought solely and exclusively in, and will be subject to the service of process and other applicable procedural rules of, the State or Federal court in New South Wales, Australia, and each party irrevocably submits to the sole and exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts in New South Wales, Australia, generally and unconditionally, with respect to any action, suit or proceeding brought by it or against it by the other party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, HubOne may bring a claim for equitable relief in any court with proper jurisdiction.</p><p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 36px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-size:16px; font-family: 'Tahoma';color:#000000;display:inline-block;width:18px;margin-left:-18px">c)</span>Injunctive Relief; Enforcement.

If any provision of this Partner Agreement is held to be void, invalid, unenforceable or illegal, the other provisions shall continue in full force and effect. This Partner Agreement may not be modified or amended except as described in Section 11 (Changes to Agreement) or otherwise with the written agreement of HubOne (which may be withheld in its complete discretion without any requirement to provide reasons). As used herein, &quot;including&quot; (and its variants) means &quot;including without limitation&quot; (and its variants). If either party to this Partner Agreement breaches any provision of this Partner Agreement relating to Confidential Information or intellectual property rights, there may not be an adequate remedy available solely at law; therefore, an injunction, specific performance or other form of equitable relief or monetary damages or any combination thereof may be sought by the injured party to this Partner Agreement. No failure or delay by the injured party to this Partner Agreement in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder at law or equity. The parties are independent contractors. This Partner Agreement shall not be construed as constituting either party as a partner of the other or to create any other form of legal association that would give on party the express or implied right, power or authority to create any duty or obligation of the other party.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
