<p>ELIZABETH THE SECOND, by the Grace of God Queen of Australia and Her Other Realms and Territories, Head of the Commonwealth, GREETING:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WHEREAS His Majesty King George the Fifth on 19 June 1928 by Royal Charter (here called &quot;the Original Charter&quot;) constituted a Body Politic and Corporate by the name of &quot;The Institute of Chartered Accountant s in Australia&quot; (here called &quot;the Institute&quot;) with perpetual succession and a Common Seal:</p>

<p>AND WHEREAS His Majesty in 1935 by Supplemental Royal Charter (here called &quot;the First Supplemental Charter&quot;) authorised certain amendments to be made to the Original Charter:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AND WHEREAS WE in 1959 by Supplemental Royal Charter (here called &quot;the Second Supplemental Charter&quot;) revoked Clauses 1 to 28 of the Original Charter and Clauses 1 and 2 of the First Supplemental Charter, and made new provisions for the governance of the Institute:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AND WHEREAS by Orders in Council dated 25 September 1964 and 9 June 1966 (here called &quot;the Orders in Council&quot;) WE were pleased to allow certain amendments to the Second Supplemental Charter:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AND WHEREAS WE in 1973 by Supplemental Royal Charter (here called &quot;the Third Supplemental Charter&quot;) revoked the Second Supplemental Charter and made new provisions for the governance of the Institute:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AND WHEREAS on 8 December 1987 WE have assigned to Our Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia all our powers and functions in respect of the issuing of Letters Patent:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-size:16px; font-family: 'Tahoma';color:#000000;display:inline-block;width:20px;margin-left:-20px">a)</span>granting a Supplemental Charter to anyone in the Commonwealth of Australia to whom a Charter of incorporation has been granted by US or Our predecessors; or</p><p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-size:16px; font-family: 'Tahoma';color:#000000;display:inline-block;width:20px;margin-left:-20px">b)</span>revoking, amending, or adding to, any Charter of incorporation or Supplemental Charter granted to anyone in the Commonwealth of Australia by US or Our predecessors,</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and have authorised Our Governor-General to exercise any of those powers and functions in Our name and on Our behalf:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AND WHEREAS in 1988 by Supplemental Royal Charter (here called &quot;the Fourth Supplemental Charter&quot;) Our Governor-General granted, ordained and declared that the Institute continue to be a Body Politic and Corporate by the name of The Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia with perpetual succession and a Common Seal but that save as aforesaid the Third Supplemental Charter be revoked but that nothing in such revocation would affect the validity or legality of any act, deed or thing done or executed under or pursuant to the provisions of the Original Charter or the Third Supplemental Charter and made new provisions for the governance of the Institute:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AND WHEREAS on 28 November, 1997 by Supplemental Royal Charter (here called &quot;the Fifth Supplemental Charter&quot;) Our Governor-General revoked the Fourth Supplemental Charter and made new provisions for the governance of the Institute:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AND WHEREAS on 23 August 2000 by Supplemental Royal Charter (here called &quot;the Sixth Supplemental Charter&quot;) Our Governor-General revoked the Fifth Supplemental Charter and made new provisions for the governance of the Institute:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AND WHEREAS on 19 August 2005 by Supplemental Royal Charter (here called &quot;the Seventh Supplemental Charter&quot;) Our Governor-General revoked the Sixth Supplemental Charter and made new provisions for the governance of the Institute:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AND WHEREAS on 22 August 2007 by Supplemental Royal Charter (here called &quot;the Eighth Supplemental Charter&quot;) Our Governor-General revoked the Seventh Supplemental Charter and made new provisions for the governance of the Institute:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That it has done so by fostering a high standard of professional education and competence and by requiring the observance of proper rules of conduct as a condition of membership; and that this has enabled the Institute to provide the Australian community with persons appropriately qualified to discharge the responsible roles demanded of public accountants as these have developed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That since WE were last pleased to allow amendments to the Original Charter the membership of the Institute has continued to increase.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That it is the belief of the Institute that public recognition of members of the Institute and the governance of the Institute would be better achieved if certain amendments were made to the Original Charter as from time to time so amended or supplemented (here called &quot;the Royal Charter&quot;).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AND WHEREAS the Institute has by that representation requested US to grant a Supplemental Charter for the above-mentioned purposes.</p>
